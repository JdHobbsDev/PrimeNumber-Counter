# PrimeNumber-Counter
Prime number counting script, you can use or PR, basically just did this in Python, C# and C++ to test my skills, I did alright.

# My Thoughts on C++

this was my first time really making a project by myself without a tutorial using C++ and It's very simple for projects like this, you just need a good understanding of math and C++ syntax
I also saw how fast it took C++ to count the prime numbers up to 100,000 compared to Python and it is incredibly much faster
